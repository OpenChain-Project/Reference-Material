# Open source contribution policy template 

# Versioning

This is version 1.0 of this template. 

This template is in alpha, meaning that it is under active development and changes regularly without incrementing the version number. 

# Introduction

This template, written by multiple governments, organizations and members of the civil society, is proposed to public administrations wanting to contribute to open-source projects or initiate their own, following the communities’ best practices and in the respect of all stakeholders. 

While any organisation can use parts of this policy, it is primarily focused on public administrations. 

It is designed to help public administrations collaborate internationally on software development and focus on delivering the highest quality services to their government and citizens.

This template allows public administrations to quickly instantiate a free / open source software (FOSS) contribution policy and respect key collaboration principles. Guidance is provided on all preliminary work or pre-requisites before releasing it in section "How to instantiate this template."

**Important:** all content included in the policy and best practices templates is designed to be optional and will need to be highly tailored for each public administration to address its legal, operational and other specifics.

The present document is structured in four parts:

* [General FOSS contribution policy template](FOSSPolicyTemplate.md) 

* [Best practices and examples aimed for developers within public administrations](BestpracticesTemplate.md)

* [How-to instantiate this template](HowToInstantiate.md)

* [General governance of the present document and how to contribute](Governance.md)

## A Note on Terminology

Because the structure and terminology of Public Administrations varies widely internationally, this template makes a few key assumptions:

* "Public Administration" refers to national, regional, or municipal government with authority to issue policy.  

* "Entity" is used throughout the template to refer to the most relevant operational units of the Public Administration. In some cases these may be Agencies, Ministries, or Municipal Administrations.
