# foss-contrib-policy-template

## Objectives:

 * Define a template free/open-source contribution policy that governments can instantiate
 * Increase contributions from civil servants and subcontractors working for governments
 * Help governments interact and work together
 * Propose best practices on engaging with open-source communities and contribute new projects
 
## Context

This template policy was drafted for the Open Government Partnership Summit that took place in Paris, December 7-9, 2016.

Discussions around this open-source policy are available here:
https://forum.etalab.gouv.fr/c/gouvernement-ouvert/FOSS-contrib-policy

Countries member of the OGP (and others) will have the possibility to instantiate this policy template locally to display a strong position for their civil servants.
