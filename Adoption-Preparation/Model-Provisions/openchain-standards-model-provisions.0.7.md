## OpenChain Model Procurement Language - A Reference Guide

## Version 1.0 DRAFT (currently version 0.7, a release candidate)

# Production Status

## On-Hold - No further work to be taken here

Concerns have been raised regarding some of the approaches taken here and we will pause this activity until they have been addressed. 

## Historical Overview

This document is a draft thinking tool for discussions around the use of OpenChain ISO/IEC 5230 or OpenChain ISO/IEC DIS 18974 or more generically open source in procurement discussions.

This document is NOT intended for use. It is a PROPOSAL for reference material by the OpenChain Project community.

Please track our open issues on GitHub if you want to contribute to this discussion. Submit ideas as comments to issues or open new issues.

# Introduction and Intent

This is a document to explore model provisions for OpenChain ISO/IEC 5230 or ISO/IEC DIS 18974 in procurement contracts and similar material. It was created with reference to the public domain Risk Grid version 12 hosted in the OpenChain Reference Library on GitHub:
https://github.com/OpenChain-Project/Reference-Material/blob/master/General-Compliance-Support-Material/Risk-Grid/risk-grid-12.md

The goal of this document is to ensure people can understand options. We will not be prescriptive and these model provisions will remain part of the OpenChain reference material. They will not be included in the OpenChain standards themselves.

# Rationale / Motivation For Development Of The Proposal

The strategic approach taken here and elsewhere in OpenChain reference material is to encourage alignment and a Path to Conformance with the process management outlined in the OpenChain Specification(s). The thinking behind this is that companies beginning their journey may be in a position to align with one or more process points, and increase alignment over time. The method of encouraging alignment is two-fold:
- demand pull from customer companies asking for OpenChain Specification(s) conformance.
- the ready availability of material to assist with these efforts.

Two examples of this strategy in action from our early days are:
- the concept of socializing OpenChain conformance as “preferred” before “required” in supplier relationships, something individual companies in our ecosystem have mentioned as their own strategic choice since our early days.
 - The early production of our Reference Training Slides as the first work product of the OpenChain Education Work Group in 2016 as a “get started here” process item, providing a first step in the alignment process that addressed one of the largest known pain points, and setting the stage for companies to proceed to implement other steps in their Path to Conformance.

Our historical Path to Conformance sequence was moved into MarkDown format by the Education Work Group partially refreshed on 2022-10-18 here:

## Version 0.7

# How to read the model provisions presented below

This document contains a series of Due Diligence Questions that may be useful prior to preparation of a contract related to procurement that expresses (a) a preference for OpenChain ISO/IEC 5230 conformance or  alternatively (b) a path to conformance demonstrated by alignment with individual process points compatible with the OpenChain ISO/IEC 5230 specification.

This document is intended to be interpreted consistently with the OpenChain Specification 2.1 (ISO5230:2020) ("OpenChain"). For a copy of the OpenChain specification, please see here [insert link]. 
- The example language it contains below is not intended for "copy and paste" inclusion in contracts.
- It is a "thinking tool" for legal staff or other parties involved in procurement to consider some matters that may be relevant to implementing or optimizing procurement approaches related to OpenChain ISO/IEC 5230 / open source license compliance.

## A Potential Series of Due Diligence Questions to be used prior to preparation of contract in the context of OpenChain ISO/IEC 5230 adoption and use

The ideal situation is to ask a supplier or similar organization "do you use OpenChain ISO/IEC 5230" and receive the reply "yes." This is the maturity situation the project would like to see in the context of efficient, effective risk reduction, resource usage reduction and procurement complexity around open source software license compliance.

More formally, that could be expressed in procurement as two questions:

### Q1: Do you have any formal certifications or conformance assessments relating to your open source compliance activities (e.g. OpenChain, ISO/IEC 5230:2020). These can be self certifications or external certifications.

### Q2 If yes, is the software to be delivered to us developed under a program which conforms to these certifications or assessments?

In the market situation of imperfect readiness by suppliers, companies beginning their journey may be in a position to align with one or more process points compatible with ISO/IEC 5230, and increase alignment over time. From the perspective of the OpenChain Project, ideally the method of encouraging alignment is two-fold:
- demand pull from customer companies asking for OpenChain Specification(s) conformance.
- the ready availability of material to assist with these efforts.

The material below is intended to provide food for thought on both points, particularly the latter. However, please note that some questions may be broader than the requirements of ISO/IEC 5230, and should be read in the context of procurement negotiations potentially "over-asking" to provoke a response that illustrates the rationale and implantation of process choices by a supplier. It also reflects the reality of practical procurement being a case of ultimately being a compromise between two parties as a result of the procurement negotiation itself.

### Q1:	Do you have a policy for selecting, using and deploying free and open source software (FOSS) components?

### Q2:	Do you provide training to staff on selecting and incorporating FOSS into your products?

### Q3:	Do you have a process for reviewing FOSS licenses and categorising the obligations/conditions attached to them?

### Q3.1 Do you have a method of recording decisions made as to whether a particular component should be incorporated or not?

### Q3.2 Are these records attributable to specific version(s) or release(s) of software?

### Q3.3 How long are the records archived for?

### Q4:	Do you use any software tools or services to assist with open source license compliance? (For example, Black Duck, Scancode, White Source, FOSSology, SW360)

### Q5.1: Have you appointed individuals with overall responsibility for open source license compliance policies, practice and procedures?

### Q5.2: Have you appointed individuals with overall responsibility for responding to open source queries from outside the organization?

### Q6: Can you provide a complete list of open source components and their respective licensing information used in any software you use or ship?

### Q7:	Do you provide customers with all materials required by the relevant open source software licenses (e.g. source code or offers to provide source, attribution notices, installation instructions)?

### Q8:	Does your organization contribute to external open source projects? Do you have a policy for handling this?


# OpenChain based representations for use in a procurement contract

*Note: This is a set of representations and obligations to be incorporated in a procurement contract. The structure follows ISO:5230:2020. The representations may also be modified to take effect as warranties and/or indemnities depending on local law and as agreed between the parties.*

*If due diligence determines that the supplier claims to be ISO 5230:2020 compliant, the following warranties apply. If the customer is **not** compliant with ISO 5230:2020 then extra care should be taken in selecting this supplier (and they should be encouraged to implement the relevant requirements, and ideally comply with ISO 5230:2020 in its entirety, and the warranties marked with an asterisk (\*) can be deleted*

*As a further example, we also provide below a shorter set of warranties which could be used where the Supplier does claim conformance. These rely on the representation that the Supplier is conformant, but do not require details of the mode of conformance to included in the Supplier Information Pack.*
